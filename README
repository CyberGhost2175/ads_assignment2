## Custom Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

## Description

This project provides a collection
 of custom implementations for common data
 structures and algorithms in Java.
 The goal is to offer robust, well-documented,
  and easy-to-use versions of structures such as linked lists,
  stacks, queues, and heaps, alongside a sorting algorithm (QuickSort),
   designed to provide foundational knowledge for educational purposes and
   to support complex data manipulation in Java applications.

## Features

- **Custom LinkedList**: Doubly linked list implementation allowing element manipulation at both ends.
- **Custom Stack**: Implements a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Custom Queue**: Implements a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure.
- **Custom MinHeap**: Provides a minimum heap that allows quick access to the smallest element.
- **QuickSort Algorithm**: A sorting algorithm for ordering elements within an array efficiently.
